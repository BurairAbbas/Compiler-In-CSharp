# Compiler-In-C#
Project of **compiler construction**. 
Compiler is created in the Windows Form C# which compile my own language.
Compiler generate *Token* by analysis from **lexical Analyzer**.  Try to cover all the scenerio to break the Character in code and remove bug in **Tokenization**.
**Syntax Analyzer** is only cover DEC and Initialize and print statement in code and all the possible error related to these 3 operations. Syntax Analyzer is not completed yet other operation are left for example For_St, While_St, If_st etc. All the methods of Non-Terminal CFGs are implemented in Syntax Analyzer, its needs a lot of debugging due to index++ in code. I submitted my project so may be i will not complete it xD.
